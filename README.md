## Installation  
  
No installation necessary. Just visit the link to the deployed app on Heroku in the [Usage](#usage) section below and sidestep installation altogether!  
  
## Usage  
  
The user can create as many additions or subtractions to their funds as they need to in a day. Once they've entered at least one transaction, the app will track their total funds over time complete with a graph. The best part is the user doesn't even need an active internet connection to interact with the app and keep track of their funds.
